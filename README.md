# OAI321 Logic Gate Design and Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the **design, implementation, and analysis** of **OAI321 complex and non-complex logic gates** using **Cadence Virtuoso**. The goal is to explore the complete VLSI design flow, from schematic creation to post-layout verification.

## Key Features
- **Schematic Design:** Developed both complex and non-complex OAI321 gate schematics.  
- **Floor Planning & Placement:** Optimized layout with efficient placement-and-routing strategies.  
- **DRC & LVS Clean:** Ensured design compliance with **Design Rule Check (DRC)** and **Layout vs. Schematic (LVS)** verification.  
- **PVT Analysis:** Conducted **Monte Carlo simulations** under various **PVT (Process, Voltage, Temperature)** corners (FF, SS, SF, FS).  
- **Pre- and Post-Layout Analysis:** Evaluated **Power, Performance, Area (PPA)** metrics along with rise/fall times and delay analysis.  

## Tools & Technologies
- **Cadence Virtuoso** (Schematic & Layout Design)  
- **Eldo** (Circuit Simulation)  
- **Monte Carlo Simulation** for variability analysis  
- **DRC & LVS Verification Tools**

## Performance Metrics
- Analyzed for **signal integrity**, **timing performance**, and **parasitic effects**.  
- Optimized area to around **8–7 μm²** while maintaining high efficiency.
